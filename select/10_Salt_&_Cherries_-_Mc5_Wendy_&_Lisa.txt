The taste of salt & cherries
Lingers on my guilt
Even miles away from the thrill
To view me from this vantage point
Makes me wonder
How I keep so still

I gotta get closer
Tho we're going too far
Let me come over
It's a beautiful day to play
With you in the dark

Hey hey
I gotta hear you say
You want it just like before
I put the music of the MC5 on
While I'm knockin on your door

My mind's imagination leads to my anticipation
For another taste of the thrill
The slightest thought of you
Will send me back in time
To that wonderful day on the hill

I'm good at the bad
And I've got it so good
I'm outta control
I wouldn't stop if I could

Hey hey
I gotta hear you say
You want it just like before
I put the music of the MC5 on
While I'm knockin on your door

I'm bad at the good
And I got it so bad
I'm sick of blurring the boys
With the girls with the boys
Just to say that I have

Hey hey
I gotta hear you say
You want it just like before
I put the music of the MC5 on
While I'm knockin on your door

Hey hey
I gotta hear you say
You want it just like before
I put the music of the MC5 on
While I'm knockin on your door

Hey hey

Hey hey

Hey hey

Hey hey
