Into my big cloud
I'm flying all the time
I'm happy
Into your bedroom
I'm watching your backside
I'm trying
Out through my window
I'm deeper all the time

Did you hear what I said?
I got salt in my head

Don't make me hurt you
I'm watching you from here
I'm happy
Eyeing and tapping
A wrecking ball of fear
I'm lying
Don't take me with you
I'm happy where I am

Today I washed my hands
I want to be alone
I want to fry
